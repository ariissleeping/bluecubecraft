# `bluecubecraft`

1. Install [`bun`](https://bun.sh/) (consider [using Homebrew](https://github.com/oven-sh/homebrew-bun#install)).
2. Run:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/lgarron/bluecubecraft && cd bluecubecraft

make dev
```

Note that you'll probably have to grant scripting access in System Settings to whichever app you run this from.
